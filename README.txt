#---------------------------------------------------------------------------#
| LoopNet is a Python tool dedicated to the automated detection, isolation, |
| and tracking of buoyant magnetic flux ropes realized in 3D global convec- |
| -tive simulations of stellar dynamos conducted on massively parallel sup- |
| -ercomputers.                                                             |
|                                                                           |
| If you've found your way here already, I apologize for the mess! LoopNet  |
| has been under sporadic, branching development for about 3 years at this  |
| point, and with early results from it now appearing in a submission to a  |
| peer reviewed journal, it is important that the code becomes publicly     |
| available.                                                                |
|                                                                           |
| With that said, right now this repository is little more than a dump of   |
| all the LoopNet-related scripts I've written over the last 3 years, com-  |
| -plete with test scripts, abandoned methods, and hard-coded file paths.   |
| Hopefully, it won't be more than a few weeks before I find the time to    |
| make this project properly deployable without a degree in archaeology!    |
